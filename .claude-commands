# Claude Commands & Guidelines

## Commit Message Format
- Always use `[claude]` prefix in commit messages
- Format: `[claude] type: description`
- Example: `[claude] feat: add new feature`

## User Commands to Remember
1. Use `[claude]` prefix for all commit messages
2. Write down user commands in files to keep them persistent
3. Keep using MDX for posts but make easier management
4. Use Tailwind CSS v4 (not v3) - be mindful of dropped features
5. Consider SSR-able styling solutions
